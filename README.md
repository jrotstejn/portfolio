- WHAT IS GOING ON UNDER THE HOOD?
1) Made in React with only Boostrap (some CSS hovering effects because Bootstrap is not good in those).
2) We chose this setup to showcase my React skills and to show that I can make a decent website with a limited library (boostrap).
3) The bootstrap-carousel (projects) scales very bad on mobile devices. I made an alternative that looks good om mobile devices.
4) Form uses the formspree-server and inputs get cleared by using the useState-hook.
