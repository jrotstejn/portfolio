                Hi, I'm Jonathan, a Junior Front End Developer who is looking for a first professional coding opportunity.
                I can create fully functional websites or applications with the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some frameworks!
                <br /> <br />
                Because of my unconventional background I have a lot of experience with Team Collaboration and have a good understanding
                of what positive Leadership stands for. On top of that IÂ´m a lifelong learner who always wants to learn the newest
                technologies and is open for new challenges!
                <br /> <br /> 
            </p>
